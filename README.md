# YouTube Clone

#### A direct clone of the popular video hosting and viewing site, YouTube.

## Description

This web app is a clone of the site [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com "YouTube Homepage") and is made with React, TypeScript, Redux Tool Kit and the YouTube Data API v3. On here, you are able to search for videos, watch videos and see the descriptions for the videos. The goal of this project was to clone YouTube as closely and as accurately as possible to showcase my ability to take a wireframe or template and translate that into a functioning and visually identical web app.
